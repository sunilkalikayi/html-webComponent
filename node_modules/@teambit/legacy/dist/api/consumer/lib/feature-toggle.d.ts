/**
 * provides an option to enable/disable experimental features before releasing them.
 * two ways to enable a feature:
 * 1) from the CLI. prefix your command with BIT_FEATURES and the features list separated by a comma.
 * 2) from the config. run `bit config set features=<features-list>` and the features list separated by a comma.
 * if the environment variable was provided, it'll skip the config.
 * the results are cached so no penalty calling it multiple times in the same process.
 *
 * to use it in the code, simply call `isFeatureEnabled('your-feature')`
 *
 * for the e2e-tests, there is a mechanism built around it, to enable/disable features per file or
 * per command. see the docs of CommandHelper class for more info.
