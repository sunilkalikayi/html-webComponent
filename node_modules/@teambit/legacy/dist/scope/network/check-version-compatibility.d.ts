 * It's safer to not let an old client interact with the server at all than enabling some commands
 * and blocking others per version.
 * Imagine when a migration script is written (e.g. when a model field is changed) and it updates
 * some hashes of the components from the old version. If a client doesn't update its version and
 * is using an old version, the flow will break sooner or later with hash-not-found exception
